# Listing Demo App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project is a demo app to showcase the renting houses listing. It has 12 items listings with their price, address, number of bedrooms, size in mÂ², date of listing, and image that is being loaded from its public folder as a static image.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Stack

- Next.js v15.1.6
- Iconify/react v5.2.0
- Tailwindcss v3.4.1
- [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/) for UI components and theme
- [Framer motion](https://motion.dev/) which comes with HeroUI as well.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo at [https://listing-smoky.vercel.app](https://listing-smoky.vercel.app).

## Note:

This of course has room for improvement and there are many ways it can be optimized specially in sorting and filtering.
I beleive this good enought at this stage.
